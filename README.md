# 5e-digital-assistant
An expansive QOL tool to streamline your D&amp;D experience.

So, I'm just getting started now, so I won't be listing much, but I'll provide a quick rundown of my ambitions.

GOALS:
* Users can store characters, including absolutely everything on their character sheet, which can be viewed 
* Users have access to a large number of calculations, performed automagically using their stored info
  * i.e. spell and weapon damage, encumberance, total pack value,etc.
* Full support for D&D 5e and all its current official supplements, plus homebrew support
* General dice calculator

Ultimately, this is intended as a learning opportunity. I'm doing this to better grow my knowledge of JS than just create a practical tool. Still, I may end up with something deployable, at which point I plan on packaging this as an Android app. But that's in the far future, as of now.

I appreciate contributions, but as this is meant as a learning experience, I ask that you instead invest that energy in a code review so I know how to improve. Still, if you're a budding dev and you want to try working on a larger project, feel free to lend a helping hand! Just keep in mind, a style exists, do try to keep yours consistent.
